# @package _global_
# (The @package _global_ directive is important to relocate the overrides below.
# For example, without the @package _global_ directive, the dataset below would be
# placed at args.experiment.Eval.dataset rather than args.dataset).
# Similarly, we have to use absolute paths for the overrides below so hydra knows
# to look for these config files relative to the `hydra_conf` root: For
# example, at `dataset` rather than `experiment/Eval/dataset`.
defaults:
- /dataset: passwordmatch
- /evaluation: DEFAULT
# This line says to take a config from the `/attack` config group (which points
# to the `hydra_conf/attack` directory as well as configs stored with
# `cs.store(group="attack")`) and place it at `evaluation.evaluation_attack`. In
# particular, we are using the GCG attack as the evaluation attack.
