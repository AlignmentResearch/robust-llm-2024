# @package _global_

# Evaluation
# This file shows you how you would set up the base yaml for an evaluation
# experiment.

# The @package _global_ directive is important to relocate the overrides below.
# For example, without the @package _global_ directive, the dataset below would be
# placed at args.experiment.dataset rather than args.dataset.
# Similarly, we have to use absolute paths for the overrides below so hydra knows
# to look for these config files relative to the `hydra_conf` root: For
# example, at `dataset` rather than `experiment/dataset`.
defaults:
- /dataset: ???
- /evaluation: DEFAULT
# This line says to take a config from `/attack` (which points to
# `hydra_config/attack`) and place it at `evaluation.evaluation_attack`.
# So if we wanted to use GCG, we would put gcg-standard in place of ???
- /attack@evaluation.evaluation_attack: ???
- /model: ???
