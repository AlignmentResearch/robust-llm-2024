# Defended Evaluation
# This file shows you how you would set up the base yaml for an evaluation
# experiment with defenses.

defaults:
- /dataset: ???
- /evaluation: DEFAULT
# This line says to take a config from `/attack` (which points to
# `hydra_config/attack`) and place it at `evaluation.evaluation_attack`.
# So if we wanted to use GCG, we would put gcg-standard in place of ???
- /attack@evaluation.evaluation_attack: ???
- /defense: ???
# If the defense needs a decoder, this is how it can be specified.
# Otherwise, this line can be deleted.
