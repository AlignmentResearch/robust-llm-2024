# robust-llm

## Installation
Clone the repository, cd into it, create a new Python 3.10 virtual environment, and then run:
```
pip install -e .
```

## Development

If you are planning to develop in the repository and thus want the optional development dependencies (for running tests, etc), then run:
```
pip install -e '.[dev]'
```

Add [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) hooks for linting and the like with:
```
pre-commit install
```

## Running experiments
Experiments are configured with [Hydra](https://hydra.cc/). You can run the default configuration with:

```
python robust_llm
```

Defaults can be overridden via the command line:

```
python robust_llm experiment.environment.seed=42
```

Alternatively, you can also define new config files, which is the recommended strategy for saving experiment configurations long term. You can see example config files in /robust_llm/hydra_conf/experiment. If you add a new file to /robust_llm/hydra_conf/experiment called `my_exp.yaml` then you can use it with:

```
python robust_llm +experiment=my_exp
```

The complete configuration used will be printed as `Configuration arguments:`. This description can be copied into a new file in the /robust_llm/hydra_conf/experiment directory if you want to repeat it later.

## Datasets

### Tomita
Tomita datasets must be pregenerated as files in order to be used in training.

They can be generated by running `robust_llm/dataset_management/tomita/tomita_dataset_generator.py`. You can edit the file's `__main__` function call to extend the range of examples to generate for training.
